# User test 1 
02.03.22

For this first user test we have let the user test our first iteration of the program. Along the way Arvid was writing down the first impressions and comments given by the user. Andreas has the role of observer, making sure that we ask the user all the questions we have agreed upon beforehand. Jan Olav has the main responsibility of interacting with the user, asking questions and making sure to show every aspect of the program.

Medium used: Discord with screensharing to show the program to the user.

Key takeaways
-	User not familiar with keywords used in the program like round robin and brackets.
        
> Addressing this next meeting.
-	Confusion related to what information is presented to the user on the program.

> Addressing this by presenting more intuitive information to the user.
- User expected mostly happy with the program, but had some expectations that weren’t met
  
> - User expected tournament information to be shown automatically when he chose to look at a tournament or player group.
> - Would like to be notified if a tournament is already stored on the program.
> - User thinks the program should have a way to show the entire tournament history. The development from game one to the finals. 
> - User wants there to be more clear information about restrictions when he gets the option to choose values in the program. 



## Summary
Mostly good feedback from the user, but there was a lot of good feedback we can work on before showcasing the next iteration of the program. When the first iteration of the program was made, the group focused heavily on making the presentation of the different functions the program offered. The functions themselves aren’t written yet, but we wanted the user to get an insight to what the program offers. Before the next user test we are focusing on building a more robust program, but also use the feedback to improve already existing code.  


## List of questions after user tests program

Follow up questions: 
1.	Does the user interface feel intuitive? 
-	Yes, for the most part I think, but I got confused about the teams, some of the presentation in “pågående kamper” seems odd that there already are stored tournament.

> 	Was done to show the user how stored tournaments were showcased in the program we made some examples, but this confused the user.
> -	For next time we will remove these examples and let the program show tournaments that the user makes in the user test. 

2.	Do the selected operations do what the user expected? 
- 	Yes, but I’m confused on what cup and round robin rules mean when I’m given the option to create a new tournament. 
> 	When the user makes a tournament, he will get the option to make one of two types of tournament brackets. These seems to be confusing and is something we will address in the next meeting.
-	Suggestion from the user: Leagues and cup rules
>   Soccer thermology 

3.	How was the feedback from the program after doing an operation? (e.g. change existing team, were the user confused if an operation had been fully/successfully completed after entering a command?) 

- When I added a team or tournaments, I expected their results would be printed automatically, at least the title of the tournament or something.
