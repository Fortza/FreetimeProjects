# Usability test 2 (MVP) 

## Introduction
Maximus Cup Arranger aim to make the process around adding, configuring, and updating
football cup tournaments easy. It serves as a football cup tournament manager in which a user
can easily configure their cup tournaments. There were three participants,
For the second user test, we have let four users test out our first minimum viable product (MVP).
### People involved
There were three participants present, an interviewer, an observer, and the user. The interviewer
was responsible for interacting with the user, asking questions, and answering the users’
questions. The observer was responsible for noting the users´ comments, first impressions,
navigational choices, satisfaction rating and issues they may face while using the program.
### Summary
The main takeaway for the usability test with the MVP was that it was intuitive to use, but with
some clear functionality shortcomings. The usability testing helped us figure out what would be
most important to the user. E.g., adding scores to a tournament.
### Demographic
We wanted to include a wider demographic in this usability test but due to time constraints and
difficulty in finding participants in a wide age-group, we ended performing user tests on the
following groups: Three in their early 20s, and one in their early 50s.
Three of the users had experience with CLI-based applications, while one user had little-to-no
experience with non-GUI applications.
A total of three out of four participants had an interest in football, while one of the users had
little-to-no interest in the sport.
### Tasks
Since we now had our MVP mostly functioning, we could test most of the application´s features,
even though aspects like adding scores to a team has yet to be implemented. 


## Results
### Usability problems
The main complaint among all testers was the lack of ability to edit the tournaments. In the
programs current state, the program is not able to perform this function. This issue is going to be
resolved in the final product.
Another concern was the program prompts, which some users found unclear. E.g., one user was
spooked by the warning “Cannot find user.dta file”. There were also questions from most users
regarding the option for choosing “Home and away”. This is going to be refined in the final
product.
One user experienced an issue with the program entering a loop after inputting the same team’s
name twice, as well as when the user chose the same team against itself in the tournament
creation process. This is also going to be fixed in the final version of the product. 

### Other feedback
A lot of the feedback received was directly based on the usability of the application. Elements
such as being able to go back to the main menu after going to tournaments, as well as getting
feedback about entered values were wishes from most users. The possibility to abort a process
was also mentioned. 

### Conclusion
The users provided valuable feedback for the continuation of the development of the application.
Based on the information provided, we are going to fix the following issues:
*  More spacious text in certain parts of the program
* Print out tournament information after creation.
*  Ability to import existing teams to a match.
* Being able to go back to the main menu after entering tournaments
*  Change the format name other to manual
*  Be able to abort a process
*  Hide password field
*  Ask for a password confirmation under user creation
*  Text to show which team is currently added, instead of the current “Write name for new
team”, which does not show which teams that are available
*  Ability to remove teams already assigned
* Fix randomize-option
