# Usability test 1 

## Introduction
Maximus Cup Arranger aims to make the process around adding, configuring and updating
football cup tournaments easy. It serves as a football cup tournament manager in which a user
can easily configure their cup tournaments.
### Summary
The main takeaway from the user test were that the program for the most part was intuitive to
use, but it lacked clarity in some areas which made the user’s expectations differ from what a
program command did and what happened e.g., when the commands ‘T’ then ‘A’ was used to
get to add teams in a tournament, and the page with ongoing and completed matches were
unclear.
### People Involved
There was a total of four participants:
1. An interviewer.
2. A person who took notes.
3. An observer.
4. The user.

### Demographic
The sample size of the user test is limited to one user due to time constraints and difficulties in
finding multiple participants which had high amount of experience in the same tournament
systems. The age group of the demographic is late 50’s with a decent amount of experience in
computer and application use. Our expectations were that the user would most likely find some
functionality unintuitive which we as system designers might consider “self-explanatory”.
### Tasks
The user had to complete predetermined sequences of interactions with the program in the form
of commands, numerical and string inputs to explore the application. This ensured that as many
aspects as possible would be explored. See 17.1.1 Interview questions and steps to go through
with user for the first user testing session 02.03.2022. in the appendix.

## Results
Most features are good, and the program is for the most part intuitive to use. Some aspects the
user displayed their concerns about were:
- How the adding teams to a tournament were unclear and confusing
- The ongoing and completed match log provided poor readability.
- Confusion regarding tournament types.
- When adding team or tournament the user expected their respective results to be printed
automatically.
