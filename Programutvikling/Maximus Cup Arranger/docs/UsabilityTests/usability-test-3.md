# Usability test 3 (Almost finished product)

## Introduction
This is the third and final user test report based on tests on users.
This test was done to make sure our software (Maximus Tournament Arranger) 
was in a good enough state to be released.


### Summary
Compared to the last tests, this time there were generally only small 
issues we got negative feedback on, and even then it was in an optimistic way. 
This time the program was more polished, and most of the test went almost 
entirely pain-free. There was one major bug that appeared as well as 
a few typos here and there, but overall the test went really well.

### People involved
3 people:
* One interviewer
* One taking notes (and moght come with separate questions)
* One test participant


### Demographic
The software is targeted towards people from 30-50 years old, who needs 
a program to keep track of one or multiple simple football tournaments. 
The usability test is to find any unintuitive spots of the software and 
give us pinpointers towards making the software more intuitive for new users.

### Tasks
The tester was asked to do tasks like logging in, create and view the 
created team, and create and edit a tournament. These tasks are done 
to see how intuitive and understandable everything is. During the test 
the tester was asked to describe if anything felt intuitive or not, 
and whether some things could be improved on.

## Results
Most tasks went without any issues, with the exception of these:
- The automatic creation of new matches using the winners of previous matches was not 
obvious at first glance, and there were no messages stating a new match was being created 
other than a list of two teams and a choice of which of them to make the home team. 
- A bug happened where the both teams from one of the last matches was put into the new match, 
when only the winner from that specific match should go on. 
- The bracket system was not obvious until a tournament with 8 teams was created and tested.

A few typos were discovered during the test as well.


### Conclusion
As most of the test went well and not many complaints were made, it was decided that the software
only needed some bug fixes and minor changes before the final deadline. The program itself worked
well, and was more or less polished enough to be released soon.
