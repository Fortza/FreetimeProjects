# Maximus Cup Arranger
Maximus Cup Arranger is an application made for tournament administrators managing a football tournaments.   
## Project description
This is a group project at NTNU in the software engineering course (PROG1004). The project assignment was to create a tool for a tournament administrator managing a multi-team tournament (any sport).   
   
We chose to make a football tournament manager. The reason for this choice was that one of our group members has a familiy member with football experience and that person was willing to do user tests.    
   
Our application, Maximus Cup Arranger, allowes the user to create teams, arrange and update multiple different tournaments with up to 16 different teams. All data from the tournaments are stored in files. The goal when creating this application was to simplify the process of arranging and managing football tournaments with multiple teams.   
   
The software is written in C++, the programming language taught at NTNU.   
Other technologies used where CMake, to help with cross platform software packaging.
